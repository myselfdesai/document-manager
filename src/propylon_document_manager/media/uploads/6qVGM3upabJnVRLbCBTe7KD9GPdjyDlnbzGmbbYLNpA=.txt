To add a closed tester in Google Play Console, follow these steps:

    Access Google Play Console:
    Log in to your Google Play Console account using your credentials.

    Select Your App:
    From the dashboard, select the app for which you want to add closed testers.

    Open "Testing" Section:
    On the left-hand side, click on the "Testing" tab or navigate to "Testing" > "Closed Testing."

    Add Testers:
        Click on "Manage Testers" or a similar option available.
        You'll find an option to "Invite Testers." Click on it.
        Enter the email addresses of the users you want to add as closed testers. These users should have Google accounts.

    Customize Testing Release:
        Choose the version of your app that you want to make available for closed testing.
        You may select specific tracks, versions, or APKs to distribute to these testers.

    Send Invitations:
        After adding the email addresses, send the invitations to the testers.
        Testers will receive an email invitation to join the testing program for your app.

    Testers' Access:
        Testers will have to accept the invitation and join the testing program using the link provided in the email.
        Once they've accepted, they'll be able to access the closed testing version of your app through the Google Play Store.

Remember, when adding testers, ensure that the email addresses are associated with valid Google accounts. Testers should follow the invitation link and join the testing program to access the app.
